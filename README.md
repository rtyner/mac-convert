# Dirty MAC Converter
#### Python script to convert a MAC to different formats
##### Ubuntu/Bash on Windows 10
* `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
* `sudo pip3 install netaddr`
* Download `mac_convert.py`
* Navigate to where you downloaded the file and issue `python3 mac_convert.py`

##### Windows 10
* Just install Bash, it's a pain to set all this up on Windows.


#### TODO
* Implement the ability to perform this operation on a file of MAC addresses
* Write a real Windows installation guide
* Possibly figure out a way to package the required libraries, or just requirements.txt
* Need a way for user to specify what format they want to convert to, and only convert to that format.
* Output to .csv
