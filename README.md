# Dirty MAC Converter
#### Python script to convert a MAC to different formats
##### Ubuntu/Bash on Windows 10
* `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
* `sudo pip3 install netaddr`
* Download `mac_convert.py`
* Navigate to where you downloaded the file and issue `python3 mac_convert.py`

##### Windows 10
* Just install Bash, it's a pain to set all this up on Windows.


#### TODO
* Implement the ability to perorm this operation on a file of MAC addresses
* Ideally you would run `mac_convert.py FILE` and it will prompt for what format you want to convert to.
